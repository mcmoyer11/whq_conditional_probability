Billy and his neighbors are playing hide and seek in the park. It is his turn to close his eyes and count to ten. 

Actually, his friends are hidden under the slide, in the tunnel, and behind the swings, but not in the tree. 

After he is finished counting, he sees his classmate Jimmy, and asks Jimmy, 
[manipulate linguistic variables]
"Where are my friends?"/"Where can I find my friends?" 

TEST1: how *likely* is it that jimmy will say [ANSWER]?
where ANSWER = {MO, MS, MA-WE, MA-SE}
Sliding scale from 0------------1

TEST2: How *acceptable* is it for Jimmy to say, [ANSWER]?
SLIDER: unacceptable------acceptable

[ms answer] "under the slide"
 OR [ma answer] "under...."


how likely is it that 




grab from corpus, 




hedge correctly! no *direct* link

baseline plausibility that there will be these 

noisy channel approach
maybe poepl didnt say exactly whta thtey meant
